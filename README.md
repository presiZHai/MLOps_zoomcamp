# MLOps-Zoomcamp @ DataTalks.Club

This repository accompanies your journey through the MLOps Zoomcamp offered by Data Talks Club. Here you'll find all the code, scripts, and notebooks used throughout the course to help you:

* Follow along with the lectures.
* Practice and build hands-on MLOps skills.
* Experiment and solidify my learnings.

Feel free to explore, tinker, and make this repository your own MLOps playground!
